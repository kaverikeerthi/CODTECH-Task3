# Project Overview 
# Project :
       End-to-End Data Science Project with Flask Deployment
       
## Objective
To build a complete end-to-end machine learning project, starting from data preprocessing and model training to deploying the model as a web application using Flask. The project allows users to input values through a web form and get real-time predictions.

##  Key Activities
## 1.Data Preprocessing & Model Training

* Loaded dataset, cleaned it, and performed feature scaling.

* Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or similar).

* Saved both the trained model and scaler as .pkl files for deployment.

## 2.Flask App Creation

* Created app.py to build the Flask server.

* Loaded model.pkl and scaler.pkl in app.py to make predictions.

## 3.Web Interface Design

* Designed a user-friendly front-end with:

* index.html: To collect input features from users

* result.html: To display prediction results


## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
* Python

* Flask â€“ for building the web application

* Scikit-learn â€“ for model training

* Pandas, NumPy â€“ for data handling

* HTML/CSS â€“ for front-end web interface

## Platform Execution
* Developed and tested in Jupyter Notebook

* Deployed the model using Flask (locally via app.py)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline â€” from data analysis and modeling to real-world deployment. It reflects the practical skills needed for real-time applications, giving users the ability to make predictions through a web interface.
